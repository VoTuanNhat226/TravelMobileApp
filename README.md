<h1>Travel App</h1>
<p>This is an application that allows users to share their travel itinerary for each stop, and the estimated time of arrival. Other users in the system who want to join the travel itinerary to reduce costs such as gas money can register to join the person posting the itinerary and the cost will be agreed upon by both parties. At the end of each shared trip, the traveler can rate the trip to increase the credibility of the person posting the trip. The system also allows users to post beautiful pictures on the travel itinerary for everyone to exchange and discuss with each other. Users are allowed to flexibly search for the itinerary to find a shared itinerary.</p>
